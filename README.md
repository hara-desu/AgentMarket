# AgentMarket

* **Agent Market** is a decentralized marketplace for various kinds of AI agents. The marketplace operates via Dutch Auction mechanism. Later planning to add functionality to choose between English Auction and Dutch Auction.

* As for now, this is an initial implementation that doesn't include demo of AI agents for potential buyers. Ideally, a user who registers an AI agent should provide a docker container with the AI agent. This docker container is stored on IPFS and when the AI agent is on sale each user can run this docker container as a demo inside this application.
